### **Overview**
This project is a secure user authentication system that integrates Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database. It provides:
- User registration with validation for secure account creation.
- Login functionality with real-time credential verification.
- A personalized user dashboard with secure session management.

---

### **Tools and Technologies**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database
- **Security Features**: Input validation, session management using `sessionStorage`, and Firebaseâ€™s built-in authentication mechanisms.

---

### **Features**
1. **User Registration**
   - Secure account creation with email validation and password strength enforcement.
   - User details are securely stored in Firebase Realtime Database.

2. **User Login**
   - Real-time credential verification through Firebase Authentication.
   - Displays error messages for invalid credentials.

3. **User Dashboard**
   - Displays a personalized welcome message using stored session data.
   - Allows users to log out securely, clearing their session.

---

### **System Workflow**

#### **1. Registration Process**
- Users register through the `Register.html` form.
- Email and password are validated before account creation.
- On successful registration:
  - Firebase Authentication creates a secure account.
  - User information is stored in Firebase Realtime Database for future use.

#### **2. Login Process**
- Users log in through the `Login.html` form.
- Firebase Authentication verifies user credentials.
- Upon successful login:
  - User session is established using `sessionStorage`.
  - User is redirected to the personalized dashboard (`Home.html`).

#### **3. Dashboard**
- The dashboard welcomes the user with a personalized message retrieved from the session data.
- Users can securely log out, which clears the session and redirects them to the login page.

---

### **Future Improvements**
1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive user data before storing it in the database for an additional layer of security.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
   - Add a secondary verification step for enhanced security.

3. **Password Reset Functionality**:
   - Enable users to securely reset their passwords via email.

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Improve the interface with additional styling and user experience features.

---

### **Conclusion**
This project highlights the ability to integrate front-end development with Firebase for secure user authentication. It demonstrates a practical approach to session management, secure data handling, and user-friendly interfaces. This system serves as a foundation for building scalable and secure web applications.
