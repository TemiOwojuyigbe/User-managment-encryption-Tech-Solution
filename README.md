# Encryption Project
Tech Solution Encryption project
Led the creation of a secure user management system using C++ and HTML. Developed a user authentication account storage database that is automatically decrypted for maximum security. With HTML, I created a unique employee management website UI for testing, supported by Firebase, which allowed me to provide a database of user authentication account storage through my website. As an alternate solution to the standard management system website, I created an interactive encryption system solely using C++ and AES in a Linux environment.
